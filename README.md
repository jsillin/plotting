# plotting

This is a repository for my personal plotting scripts. Most pull data from NOMADS using the openDAP functionality that plays very nicely with xarray. The drawback is that NOMADS is not exactly super reliable...

Plots range from basic precipitation type/upper-air to dashboard plots showing many different parameters at once.
